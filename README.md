# Sales Analysis
  
  This jupyter notebook consist of analysis I made on a Amazon dataset(practice dataset) which includes cleaning of data and an effort to find ways for the company to make more profit.
  by using Data Visualization and Data Analysis.  
  The tools I used in this are Matplotlib, Pandas and Numpy. Also some packages from OS library.  
  
  Important Questions I answered are:   
  * WHich was the best month for sales and how much they earned that particular month?
  * What city sold the most product?
  * At what time should the company post ads to maximize the product being sold?
  * Which products are most sold together?
  
  ### *Feel free to go through the code and give any suggestions for the following ☺*
